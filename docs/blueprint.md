# **App Name**: VoxelTerm

## Core Features:

- 3D Terminal Rendering: Render a 3D terminal environment using Three.js, complete with simulated CRT monitor effects.
- Command Input: Accept and display typed commands within the 3D terminal.
- Command Output Simulation: Simulate command execution and display output within the 3D terminal window, mimicking a real terminal.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Lime (#BFFF00) to represent the bright glow of classic terminals.
- Background color: Very dark grey (#1A1A1A) to emulate an unlit monitor screen.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements or command outputs.
- Use a monospaced font to mirror that of old terminal interfaces, such as Courier New, for code legibility and an authentic retro aesthetic.
- Minimal iconography within the 3D space to avoid clutter, focusing on text-based interaction, as a classic terminal interface would offer.
- Arrange terminal elements like the command input and output area in a straightforward, vertically-aligned layout inside the 3D scene to keep the experience faithful to standard terminals.
- Introduce scan-line and flicker effects via fragment shaders and other effects on the simulated CRT screen.
